# Zebra - plugin for striped backgrounds

This plugin creates a Figma frame with a rectangular that has stripes generated using a linear gradient. I do not recommend exporting the background CSS from Figma because it is much bigger than generating it with a tool such as https://stripesgenerator.com/. The reason behind that is Figma currently does not implement repeating background images.
